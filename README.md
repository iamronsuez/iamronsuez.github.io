### Resume

I am an agile Software Developer, passionate about working with Software as Service-based applications, developing APIs, and crafting intuitive user interfaces.

### About me

I'm a Venezuelan proficient Full-stack Developer and entrepreneur enthusiast. I was fascinated by computers, software, and systems from a young age. At 16 years old, I started my bachelor of Informatic Engineering.

Back then, I started to learn about algorithms, problem abstraction, and programming in general. In 2012 I started my professional career working as a web freelancer, and later I joined several small companies learning a lot about programming and contributing to their growth and development.

In 2017 I reallocated to Santiago, Chile, hired to work for a video streaming company. Since then, I have worked for several companies in the retail industry. I'm currently working as Semi Senior Software Engineer at a top Ecommerce Company with a presence in all of Latin America.

## Personal Projects

### Punto Transfer

Like many Venezuelans, I found myself in need to send money to my family, and due to the economic blockages in my country, I had to resort to alternative mechanisms to send monthly remittances.

Aware of this, taking advantage of the opportunity to provide a service to solve this problem, I assembled a team with family members living in Venezuela and almost all the countries of South America. From there, [PuntoTransfer](https://www.instagram.com/punto_transfer/?hl=es) was born, which is a money remittance company.

As founder and Core Engineer, I contributed to this company assembling a team for the construction of the infrastructure to manage the sending of remittances, which includes the processes of publication of monetary rates between countries, the purchase and sale of money using cryptocurrencies through platforms such as Binance and finally the sending of the remittance as such.

This is done by integrating an admin site and Slack workspace where remittances are published, and staff in different countries are responsible for transferring money to clients.

Technologies utilized in this project include NodeJS, Strapi, Pipedream, and Slack API.

## Miscelanea

 I've several hobbies such as cycling (I try to do it at least twice a month), playing video games ( I often play League of Legends LOL), and traveling (The last trip was to New York, and it was Awesome). I also like to read political, historical, and entrepreneurship books.
