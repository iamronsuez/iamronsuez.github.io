### About me

I'm a Venezuelan Senior Software Engineer with expertise in distributed systems, API integration, and AI-driven solutions. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at UNIR while leading critical technical initiatives at Walmart Chile.

With over 7 years of professional experience, I've worked across the tech stack - from building OTT platforms for major media companies to architecting financial services gateways for Latin America's largest e-commerce platforms. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Universidad Catolica Andres Bello, complemented by Cisco networking certifications.

In 2017 I relocated to Santiago, Chile, where I've contributed to transformative projects at companies like Mediastream, Cencosud, Mercado Libre, and now Walmart Chile. My current focus combines technical leadership with AI expertise to drive innovation in e-commerce SEO and system integration.

## Personal Projects

### Punto Transfer

Like many Venezuelans, I found myself in need to send money to my family, and due to the economic blockages in my country, I had to resort to alternative mechanisms to send monthly remittances.

Aware of this, taking advantage of the opportunity to provide a service to solve this problem, I assembled a team with family members living in Venezuela and almost all the countries of South America. From there, [PuntoTransfer](https://www.instagram.com/punto_transfer/?hl=es) was born, which is a money remittance company.

As founder and Core Engineer, I contributed to this company assembling a team for the construction of the infrastructure to manage the sending of remittances, which includes the processes of publication of monetary rates between countries, the purchase and sale of money using cryptocurrencies through platforms such as Binance and finally the sending of the remittance as such.

This is done by integrating an admin site and Slack workspace where remittances are published, and staff in different countries are responsible for transferring money to clients.

Technologies utilized in this project include NodeJS, Strapi, Pipedream, and Slack API.

## Miscelanea

 I've several hobbies such as cycling (I try to do it at least twice a month), playing video games ( I often play League of Legends LOL), and traveling (The last trip was to New York, and it was Awesome). I also like to read political, historical, and entrepreneurship books.
