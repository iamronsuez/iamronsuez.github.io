# Ronald Suez / A guy who thinks before code.

### Resume

I am an agile Web Developer, passionate about working with Software as a Service based applications, REST APIs (I love swagger) and several web application frameworks. I like to build MEAN based systems , microservices and deploying apps using Amazon Web Services or Heroku.


### About me

I'm a proficient full stack developer and entrepreneur enthusiast, since a young age I was fascinated about computers, software and systems, when I was 16 I started my bachelor of Informatic Engineering at [UCAB Guayana](http://guayanaweb.ucab.edu.ve/), I learned about algorithms, problem abstraction and programming in general.

When I was 20 I started to work on the Internet field programming several web development projects using platforms like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ba4f039661b19550), that opportunity crafted my experience working remotely using a foreign language with people from around the world, since there I've been looking for the best tools and approaches to solve any kind of problems using the computer science technologies. 

Today, i'm still eager to build new things, meet great people, develop ideas and generate better solutions to the people. 


## Skills 


### Frontend

I have been working with angularJs for several projects, I use John Papa's Angular style guide, I use Less/Sass in order to craft beautiful interfaces,  I've used several frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation and Angular Material (this one is my favorite :D )I use gulp with several tasks for develop and production phases.

Today i'm learning React and Angular in order to make better web applications using the cutting edge technologies outhere.

### Backend

I've worked with php, ruby, python and node.js, I turned my choice to node.js due its flexibility and usability, my normal stack is like a MEAN stack but decoupled from the Frontend, I love to build REST APIs and wrap my services around it, I've deployed production code to AWS, including hosting , domain and ssl configuration,  my web server of choice is nginx due its simplicity and its performance. 

Today i'm learning about Golang and the microservices pattern as i've developed several complex backend running as a monolithic block and i want to migrate them to a more decoupled ecosystem.

### Mobile

I've succesfully developed a few projects with several hybrid frameworks including phonegap and ionicv1, although i've a beginner experience in Switf / IOS today i'm turning my expertise path in this field to React Native doing several small projects for fun and learning.

### Networking

At  [UCAB](http://guayanaweb.ucab.edu.ve/descripcion-de-la-academia.html), I attended to the CCNA EXPLORATION course, completing the 4 modules succesfully.

### Entrepeneourship
