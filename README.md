## Personal Projects

### Punto Transfer

Like many Venezuelans, I found myself in the need to send money to my family and due to the economic blockages in my country, I had to resort to alternative mechanisms to be able to send monthly remittances.

Aware of this, taking advantage of the opportunity to provide a service to solve this problem, I assembled a team with family members living in Venezuela and almost all the countries of South America. From there, [PuntoTransfer](https://www.instagram.com/punto_transfer/?hl=es) was born, which is a money remittance company.

My contribution to the company has been to assemble a team for the construction of the infrastructure to manage the sending of remittances, which includes the processes of publication of monetary rates between countries, the purchase and sale of money using cryptocurrencies through platforms such as Binance and finally the sending of the remittance as such.

This is done through an integration between an admin site and Slack workspace where remittances are published and staff in different countries are responsible for transferring money to clients.

## Miscelanea

 I've several hobbies such as cycling, play videogames, travel, among others. I also like to read political, historic and entreprenourship books.
